## Functional Programing in Scala leveraging Scala's Std Libraries 

### Description

Using the Scala3 standard libraries to work through the path laid
out in Functional Programming in Scala by Chiusana & Bjarnason. Guided
by ShapelessCat/fpinscala3 Scala3 version of the books exercises.

### Purpose

Unlike the book exercises, the purpose is not to create an entire FP
infrastructure from scratch. Instead it is to leverage the Scala
Standard libraries, and selected external libraries, to give *efficient*
examples of Functional Programming. By *Functional* I do not necessarily
mean *pure*. Functional interfaces are fine. I am willing to push
*Imperative* code to innermost scopes in threadsafe ways.
