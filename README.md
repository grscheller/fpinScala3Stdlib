# Functional Programing in Scala Using Scala3 via Scala3 Std Libraries

Leverage the Scala3 standard libraries to work through the path laid
out in Functional Programming in Scala by Chiusana & Bjarnason. Guided
by ShapelessCat/fpinscala3 Scala3 version of the books exercises.

I got through Chapter 9, Parsor Combinators, on my own. I last worked on
it Jul 17, 2021 when I updated for use with Scala 3. The last version
of this is contained in the exercises branch of this repo. Its
development history is contained in my grscheller/scheller-linux-archive
repo. I intially started work on it on Apr 10, 2016.
